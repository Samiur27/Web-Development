    Hello everyone!</p>
    <p id="blue-font"> I am Samiur and currently I am studying CSE in Brac University. It is my third semester and guess what I am in my residential semester right now which is also callled <strong>TARC</strong>. Every BracU student is aware of it but for those who don't know, RS<mark>(Residential Semester)</mark> is a unique programme for every BracU students where they have to stay and complete a whole semester away from home at Birulia,Savar. This is compulsory for all BracU students, regardless of their departments. So before I come to RS, I have completed my two semesters online due to Covid situation.Hence I couldn't make much friends. Morever, I haven't stayed away from home before I came to RS. As a result, I was a bit nervous before coming here. But after I stayed here for some days, I was able to make a lot of new friends.So I don't feel lonely anymore.Now let me talk about my routine in RS. Every morning, we have our breakfast in the Dining Hall and then everyone rush to their classes.By 2 pm, we have to complete our lunch.After the classes, we are free to anything till evening. At 7 pm, we have a study hour and at that time nobody is allowed to roam around.We have our dinner by 9:30 and then we can study or go to sleep.The most important thing that I liked about RS is discipline and staying in the nature, away from the chaos of bustling city life.Playing in the fields and chilling with friengs are also something which I really enjoy. However, I miss my parents the most. I also miss the family gettogethers and hanging out with my friends in Dhaka.</p><p class="deep-pink"><strong >"Hopefully khub taratari ami jiboner mane khuje paboðŸ˜‚"</strong></p>
